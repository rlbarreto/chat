I did not make a option to register a new user. To make it so, it is needed to post a JSON like

{"username": "USER NAME TO REGISTER", "password": "A PASSWORD"}

to

http://localhost:3000/api/


In my tests I used postman to do it.

I am using mongo to save all the data. The db name is trycatch.

If I had a little more time, I would use Angular2, but I did not want to take that risk.
